# Kadoa - Senior Software Engineer Assignment

### Requirements

#### Backend (TypeScript)
- Implement a live server that supports CRUD operations for Kanban tasks.
- Choose a real-time mechanism (WebSockets, Server-Sent Events, gRPC, Polling, etc.).
- Design a suitable database schema for storing tasks (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or SQLite).
- Ensure proper validation and error handling.

#### Frontend (Next.js + TypeScript)
- Create a simple UI that allows adding, updating, deleting, and moving Kanban tasks.
- Ensure the UI updates in real-time when tasks are modified.

#### AI/LLM Integration
- Use an LLM to create new tasks from natural language input.

### Deliverables
- A TypeScript implementation of the Kanban app (frontend and backend), with relevant testing.
- Clear instructions in a `README.md` file to reproduce the project locally, plus a brief technical explanation of design choices and scalability concerns.

#### Design & Scalability Considerations

Add answers to `README.md` > Design & Scalability Considerations

- How would you structure the data model for tasks, columns, and users?
- How would you scale this system to support multiple users collaborating in real time?
- What trade-offs would you consider when choosing between WebSockets and REST polling?
